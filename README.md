# Build a Portfolio Site project

A responsive website with HTML5 and CSS3 from a provided PDF design mockup.

## Project Overview 
You will be provided a design mockup as a PDF-file and must replicate that design in HTML and CSS. You will develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects you will complete through the course of the Front-End Web Developer nanodegree.

Once you've successfully replicated the design mockup, you are encouraged to continue tweaking and making customizations to the design to personalize it and make it your own!


## How To Run

  - Download the code
  - Extract compressed file
  - Open index.html file with your favourite browser
  
  
## Why this Project?
The first thing potential employers look for isn’t which school you attended or what your GPA was; they want to see what you’ve built! You need a professional portfolio to show off your skills.

In this project you’ll build a great look portfolio where you can show off images, descriptions and link to all of your projects. You'll do so writing code that conforms to the [Udacity Style Guide](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/).

## What will I learn?
You will learn how HTML is used to define the content of a web page and start to think of every web page as a number of boxes on the screen. You’ll then learn how to position those boxes and make them beautiful using CSS.

You'll accomplish this while conforming to a [style guide](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/) which is an important constraint once you step into any existing development position.

# Project Details

## How do I Complete this Project?
This project is connected to the [Intro to HTML and CSS course](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud304-nd) but depending on your background knowledge of HTML and CSS you may not need to take the entire course to complete this project. 

Be sure to follow the [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/?_ga=1.163963583.12280332.1465333852#!/projects/2736698543/rubric) closely when designing your page. For example, note that [HTML5 structural (semantic) elements](https://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML_structural_elements#Enter_HTML5_structural_elements) must be used to organize content.
